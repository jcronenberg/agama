# Migrate wicked
This project creates a `migrate-wicked` binary which is able to parse wicked xml configs and send them to a NetworkManager dbus service.
## Architecture
`migrate-wicked` uses agama as a library to communicate the parsed network state to NetworkManager
but the binary is completely independent of any agama services and can be run standalone
## Obtaining wicked xml config
A wicked config xml can be generated by running `wicked show-config > wicked.xml` which can then be passed to `migrate-wicked`
## Testing
Running the migration on a live system isn't currently recommended. To test it's recommended to use a container
(instructions how to set one up can be found [here](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/blob/master/rust/agama-cli/doc/backend-for-testing.md))  
Example configurations can be found under `tests`
